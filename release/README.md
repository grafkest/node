# Release Artifacts

This folder stores the packaged Windows executable when you download it from a GitHub release or build it locally with `npm run build:exe`. The binary itself is not tracked in Git to avoid repository hosting limits that reject large binaries.

Place the downloaded `domain-graph.exe` in this directory so `run-domain-graph.bat` can start it automatically.
